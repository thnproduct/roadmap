# Foresight Roadmap Voting App

![](https://github.com/upstash/roadmap/blob/main/ss.png)

You can deploy Roadmap application yourself and ask your users to vote for your roadmap features. See the [live example](https://roadmap.upstash.com).

In this version, the user should sign up (via Auth0) to add a new feature and vote them up. Also you can configure yourself as admin, to set a feature request as `release` also delete any feature request.

If you prefer the one without authentication, see the [old version](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-redis).
